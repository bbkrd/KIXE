        Calculates the growth rate contribution of a chained time series (iContr) to another chained time series (iTotal) lagged by #ofLags.<br/>
        The number of lags must be between 1 and the periodicity of the time series. Chaining and unchaining is done with the one-quarter overlap method (one-month overlap method).<br/>
